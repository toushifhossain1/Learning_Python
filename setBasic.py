# A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable* ( But new items can be added and removed ), and unindexed

mySet = {"value1", 2, "string", 3.14}
#mySet = set(("value1", 2, "string", 3.14))

# print(type(mySet))

# the only way to access the elements inside a set is to loop through the set

for x in mySet:
    print(x)
