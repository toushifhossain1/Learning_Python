# Python is not a strong Encapsulated language ( Not having more privacy like C++ and JAVA ) it is said by its author

# To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variables.
# we use the names to make others understand that we are naming it as protected or private; JUST FOR LETTING THEM KNOW
# T he can still make changes if they want to


# Protected: Can be accessed by the Base Class and Subclass
# Notation : single underscore “_”.


# Private: Can only be used by the Base Class
# Notation : double underscore “__”.
