# The difference between Tuple and List is that Tuple is unchange able directly
# The only way to change a tuple value is to store it in a list and convert back to tuple
# Tuples are useful for using with Dictionary key


thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")
print(thistuple)
print(len(thistuple))  # Prints the length of the tuple
